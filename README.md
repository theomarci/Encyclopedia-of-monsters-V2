# Encyclopedia-of-monsters-V2

<p>
  this is my second project to make better the encyclopedia of monsters.

  Why i want to rework my encyclopedia ?
  The first reason that i wish to improve my work is because I want to have a better front, more responsive, with a better design. For this reason, I rework my project with React js for the front, Django for the back and perharps postgreSQL for my monsters data base.

  ✅draw the design of my website <br>
