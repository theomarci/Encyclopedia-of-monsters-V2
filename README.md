# Encyclopedia-of-monsters-V2

<p>
  this is my second project to make better the encyclopedia of monsters.
</p>
<p>
  Why i want to rework my encyclopedia ?
  The first reason that i wish to improve my work is because I want to have a better front, more responsive, with a better design. For this reason, I rework my project with React js for the front, Django for the back and perharps postgreSQL for my monsters data base.

  ✅draw the design of my website

  ❌create two branch one foor the front and an another for the back
  ❌install React js
  ❌create and design the different webpages
